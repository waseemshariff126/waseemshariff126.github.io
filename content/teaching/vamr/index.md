Furthermore, I held the role of lead teaching assistant for the embedded systems component of the course. In this capacity, I was responsible for:
- Designing and delivering comprehensive lab sessions focused on practical coding skills.
- Teaching Unix command line fundamentals and Bash scripting to equip students with essential tools for automation and system management.
- Instructing Python programming, emphasizing its application in computer vision and data processing.
- Introducing students to OpenCV for real-time image processing and computer vision tasks.
- Guiding students through deep learning techniques optimized for embedded platforms, specifically using Raspberry Pi as a hands-on platform for experimentation.

This role involved developing detailed course materials, organizing interactive workshops, and providing one-on-one mentoring, ensuring that students gained both theoretical insights and practical experience in coding and deploying solutions on resource-constrained embedded systems.
